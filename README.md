```hcl
# main.tf

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = var.location
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-network"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {
  name                 = "internal"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.2.0/24"]
}

resource "azurerm_network_interface" "example" {
  name                = "example-nic"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  ip_configuration {
    name                          = "internal"
    subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.example.id
    private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "example" {
  name                = "example-machine"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  size                = var.vm_size
  admin_username      = "adminuser"
  network_interface_ids = [
    azurerm_network_interface.example.id,
  ]

  admin_ssh_key {
    username   = "adminuser"
    public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
  }

  os_disk {
    caching              = "ReadWrite"
    storage_account_type = "Standard_LRS"
  }

  source_image_reference {
    publisher = "Canonical"
    offer     = "UbuntuServer"
    sku       = "18.04-LTS"
    version   = "latest"
  }
}

# variables.tf

variable "location" {
  description = "Azure region"
  default     = "East US"
}

variable "vm_size" {
  description = "Size of the VM"
  default     = "Standard_DS1_v2"
}

# outputs.tf

output "vm_id" {
  description = "ID of the Azure VM"
  value       = azurerm_linux_virtual_machine.example.id
}

output "vm_private_ip" {
  description = "Private IP address of the Azure VM"
  value       = azurerm_network_interface.example.private_ip_address
}
```

## 5. Terraform Modules
(Example remains similar, but using Azure resources)

## 6. State Management and Collaboration
6.1 Remote State Storage

Example: Configuring Azure Blob Storage Backend

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "tfstate"
    storage_account_name = "tfstate1234"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

## 7. Advanced Terraform Concepts
(Concepts remain similar, examples would use Azure resources)

Example: Dynamic Network Security Group Rules

```hcl
resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "example" {
  name                = "example-nsg"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  dynamic "security_rule" {
    for_each = var.nsg_rules
    content {
      name                       = security_rule.value.name
      priority                   = security_rule.value.priority
      direction                  = security_rule.value.direction
      access                     = security_rule.value.access
      protocol                   = security_rule.value.protocol
      source_port_range          = security_rule.value.source_port_range
      destination_port_range     = security_rule.value.destination_port_range
      source_address_prefix      = security_rule.value.source_address_prefix
      destination_address_prefix = security_rule.value.destination_address_prefix
    }
  }
}

variable "nsg_rules" {
  type = list(object({
    name                       = string
    priority                   = number
    direction                  = string
    access                     = string
    protocol                   = string
    source_port_range          = string
    destination_port_range     = string
    source_address_prefix      = string
    destination_address_prefix = string
  }))
  default = [
    {
      name                       = "allow_http"
      priority                   = 100
      direction                  = "Inbound"
      access                     = "Allow"
      protocol                   = "Tcp"
      source_port_range          = "*"
      destination_port_range     = "80"
      source_address_prefix      = "*"
      destination_address_prefix = "*"
    },
    {
      name                       = "allow_https"
      priority                   = 101
      direction                  = "Inbound"
      access                     = "Allow"
      protocol                   = "Tcp"
      source_port_range          = "*"
      destination_port_range     = "443"
      source_address_prefix      = "*"
      destination_address_prefix = "*"
    }
  ]
}
```
